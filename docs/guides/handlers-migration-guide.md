# Handlers Migration Guide

In this guide, we're going to walk through the steps necessary for a bridge administrator to complete when a customized ERC20/721/generic handler is to be used instead of the default ERC20/721/generic handler.

**NOTE:** this includes token migration as well as registering a new handler address. 

#### TODO:
- should this also assume that the new handler has been deployed previously?
